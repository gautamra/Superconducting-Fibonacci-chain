# Superconducting-Fibonacci-chain
This repository is a collection of tools and data I will use to study the properties of a superconducting Fibonacci chain.

Most of the code is written in Python. In addition to the packages NumPy and Matplotlib, I've used kwant for setting up tight binding calculations, and lmfit for non-linear fitting.
